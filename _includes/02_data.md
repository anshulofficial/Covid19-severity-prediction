We have compiled and cleaned a large
corpus of county-level and hospital-level data up to May 14, 2021 from a variety of public sources to
aid data science efforts to combat COVID-19. At the county level, our data include
COVID-19 cases/deaths from USA Facts and NYT, automatically updated every day, along with demographic information, health resource availability, COVID-19
health risk factors, and social mobility information. At the hospital level, our data
include the location of the hospital, the number of ICU beds, the total number
of employees, and the hospital type.
